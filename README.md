My name is Arome John Ozigagu. I am currently pursuing my PhD program in Civil Engineering with a special focus on Transportation Engineering. I love football(soccer) and enjoy watching it at my leisure time. I am from Nigeria. My favorite meal is 'pounded yam' garnished with 'egusi' soup-a popular Nigerian delicacy.
